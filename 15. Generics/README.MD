# Generics in go langugage

<p> Generics is a feature that allows us to create functions, interfaces, and types that can work with any type. This is a very powerful feature that allows us to write more flexible and reusable code. </p>

` Generics is the concept which refers to the ability to write code that can work with any type. `

in the file [main.go](main.go) we have a function that takes a slice of integers and returns the sum of all the elements in the slice. We can use this function to sum up the elements in any slice of integers. But what if we want to sum up the elements in a slice of floats? Or a slice of strings? We would have to write a new function for each type. This is not very flexible. We can use generics to write a function that can work with any type.

Here is the syntax for a generic function:

```go
func sum(T any) any {
    // Do something
}
```

The `any` keyword is a placeholder for any type. We can use this function to sum up the elements in any slice of any type.
